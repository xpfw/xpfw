# Roadmap

## Required
- don't use lodash as a full package but only include the ones needed via the subpackages "lodash.*"
- improve typedoc

## Nice to have
- permissions
  - role support for permission system
  - client side permission checks for e.g. forbidden pages
  - improved per field permissions
