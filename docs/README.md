# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation of the modular (x)ross (p)latform (f)rame(w)ork **xpfw**.

xpfw is a collection of packages to make forms and backend independent CRUD-UI's in React (Native) more concise.

In case you want a ready to go package check out the readily usable [stacks](stacks/overview.md).

If you wish to find more about the framework and its customization options you should get to know the three main packages:
- **Forms**:  [Themable](forms/themes.md) React (Native) Components to render a [JSON-Schema definition](https://json-schema.org/).
- **UI**: [Themable](forms/themes.md) React (Native) Components to get a full CRUD from a [JSON-Schema definition](https://json-schema.org/).
- **Permissions**: [permission](core/permissions.md) validations based on an Schema definitions.
