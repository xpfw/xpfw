# xpfw

xpfw is a collection of packages to make rendering forms and having CRUD-UI's in React as well as React Native blast. Check out the [live demo](https://xpfw.github.io) to see what's possible

It is divided into three main packages:
- [Core](#Core)
- [Forms](#Forms)
- [UI](#UI)

## Core
[@xpfw/validate](https://xpfw.github.io/form), the core of xpfw, allows you to do form and permission validations based on a simple form definition.

## Forms
[@xpfw/form](https://xpfw.github.io/form) allows you to visualize the form definitions and their validation suggestions in React and React Native.

## UI
[@xpfw/ui](https://xpfw.github.io/ui) gives you a fully usable CRUD-UI for React and React Native!

## Customization
xpfw is all about integration.
You can connect [@xpfw/ui](https://xpfw.github.io/ui) [to any backend](https://xpfw.github.io/docs/ui/backend).
[@xpfw/form](https://xpfw.github.io/form) and [@xpfw/ui](https://xpfw.github.io/ui) are also [built to be themed](https://xpfw.github.io/docs/ui/theme) with ease.

## Preact
xpfw has full preact compatability. In fact all jest tests use preact instead of react to render, and the [live demo / website](https://xpfw.github.io) is also uses preact.
